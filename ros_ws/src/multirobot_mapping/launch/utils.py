"""
Loads a base Gazebo-ROS bridge YAML file and rewrites the topic names to include a robot-specific namespace.
Also updates message types from TwistStamped to Twist, if needed.
This utility adjusts TurtleBot3’s default bridge YAML config to support namespaces for ROS2 and gz.
The provided YAML file is reused but modified at runtime to prefix each topic with a namespace.
This is essential in multi-robot simulation, where each robot must publish and subscribe to its
own isolated set of topics (e.g., /tb0_1/cmd_vel) to avoid collisions.
It also normalizes message types (e.g., TwistStamped → Twist) where needed for compatibility.


Args:
    base_yaml_path (str): Path to the base YAML bridge configuration.
    namespace (str): Namespace prefix to apply to all ROS and Gazebo topic names.

Returns:
    str: Path to the modified, namespaced YAML file saved in /tmp.

"""
This function loads an SDF model file and updates its topic definitions by prefixing them with a namespace.
Many simulation models (like TurtleBot3) have hardcoded topic names (e.g., <topic>cmd_vel</topic>).
To run multiple robots simultaneously, these topics must be isolated per robot using namespaces.  The gz plugins suppose
to prefix them with robot name but it's not. This function ensures that all relevant topic tags (for turtlebot3) in the SDF (like cmd_vel, odom, imu, etc.)
are updated accordingly so each instance operates independently in the simulation. 
For custom models, user must update below text accordingly.

Args:
    model_path (str): Path to the original SDF model file.
    namespace (str): Namespace to prepend to each topic.

Returns:
    str: Modified SDF content with namespaced topics.
